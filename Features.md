# Expert Mode Feature Ideas

1) **Custom pipelines** – let users save/share preset pipelines (e.g., “Social fast”, “Print lossless”) combining format targets, quality, and pre-processing steps.
2) **Scheduling & webhooks** – accept URLs to fetch images, run optimizations on a schedule, and deliver results via webhooks or signed download links.
3) **Storage targets** – push outputs directly to S3/GCS/Azure blobs with per-target credentials and folder templates.
4) **Watermarking** – optional text/image watermark layer applied before compression, with position/opacity controls.
5) **Diff & visual QA** – generate side-by-side and SSIM/PSNR scores to verify fidelity before downloading or publishing.
